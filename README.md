# MilLex: AI/Big Data-Based Military Translator

This project is an AI/Big Data-based translator designed to bridge the language gap between Korean and English for military purposes, specifically for the Republic of Korea (ROK) armed forces.

## Project Overview

MilLex is a specialized translation tool that leverages advanced AI and big data technologies to provide accurate and context-aware translations of military terminology. The primary goal is to facilitate clear and effective communication in joint military operations, intelligence sharing, and other multilingual environments involving the ROK armed forces.

### Key Features

- **Specialized Military Terminology:** The translator is trained on a vast corpus of military documents, manuals, and communication logs to ensure high accuracy for specialized terms.
- **Korean-English Translation:** The core functionality is to translate between Korean and English, the two primary languages in ROK-US combined operations.
- **AI-Powered:** Utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models to understand the context and nuances of military language.
- **Big Data Integration:** Continuously learns and improves from new data, ensuring the translator stays up-to-date with evolving terminology and slang.
